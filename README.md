# Ford Go bike Data Analysis  
## by Caleb Denzeil.


## Dataset

> The ford Gobike dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset has 16 columns and 183412 rows.

>During assesing, I realized the dataset wasn't clean cause it had issues like some missing values and some columns were not in the right format. After cleaning the number of rows were reduced to 174952 and I did some feature engineering which resulted to an increase of the columns to 21.


## Summary of Findings

>The first type of analysis that I started with was univariate exploration. Starting from the first analysis that I did, more males ride bikes compared to females. The majority of user types are subribers that are represented at 89.17 % while customers10.83 %.

> Most of the riders take 300-700 seconds to ride a bike which is approximately 5 to 11 minutes. As I mentioned earlier, I did some feature engineering and I divided the start and end time columns to other divisions like the starting hour and day. This helped me greatly to know more about the data. I plotted a countplot and thursday had the highest number of riders while Saturday and Sunday have less riders.

> Their was a clear indication that most people showed up between 07:00 in the morning and at 17:00 in the evening. The most used starting station was Market St at 10th and San Francisco Caltrain Station was the most used ending station.

>After that, I moved to bivariate exploration and on thursday subscribers and customers show up the most and are less on the weekends(sun and sat). I did a comparison between customers and subscribers depicting their show up during the day, from my analysis I realized that most customers ride between 17 and 18 while subscribers either 8 or 17.

>The customers duration is much lower compared to the subscribers.

>The average duration is high on the weekends compared to (Mon-Fri)

>The last visualization that I did was multivariate and it was clear that customers lasted longer than subscribers on average from Sunday to Saturday

>Lastly, The number of riders tend to be high between (Mon-Fri) and most of the riders are male subscribers.



## Key Insights for Presentation

>Subscribers tend to use the bikes more oftenly and more compared to Customers. They also take a much longer time to ride.
